		<h1 align="center">San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Happened 1973.</li>
			<li>In San Antonio tax money received by schools was based on taxes in the local area, meaning richer districts received more money and poorer districts received less.</li>
			<li>Demetrio Rodriguez and other parents of the Edgewood Independent School District argued locally based education taxes violated the 14th amendment's equal protection clause.</li>
			<li>Parents filed a lawsuit against 7 other school districts, the Bexar County School Trustees, and the State of Texas itself.</li>
			<li>Eventually the Bexar County School Trustees and the school districts were dropped from the case, leaving only the State of Texas as the defendant.</li>
			<li>The Supreme Court decided by a narrow majority that the right to education was neither "explicitly nor implicitly" found anywhere in the Constitution, and therefore was not protected by it, meaning Rodriguez lost the case.</li>
