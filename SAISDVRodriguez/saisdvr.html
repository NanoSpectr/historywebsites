		<h1 align="center">San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</h1>
		<br>
		<p>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez was a Landmark court case that changed the way education taxes
		were distributed. Before this court case education taxes were tied to local property values, leading to wealthier areas
		receiving more tax money than areas in poverty. Demetrio Rodriguez and other parents from the Edgewood area of San Antonio
		filed a suit against 7 school districts, the Bexar Country School Trustees, and the State of Texas itself, arguing that
		locally based education taxes violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. It was not until 1972 that it 
		reached the supreme court, and it was not until 1973 that a decision was reached. Rodriguez lost the case, as the Supreme
		court held that basing education taxes on local property values was not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's
		equal protection clause.</p>
